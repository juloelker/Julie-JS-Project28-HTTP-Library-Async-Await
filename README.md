# Julie-JS-Project28-HTTP-Library-Async-Await

This project uses a simple library of GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests written with async/await functions in a JS class. This is from the Traversy Media class, Modern JavaScript from the Beginning, section 7, lesson 72.  In the future, I will follow this coding pattern to create a library of famous quotes.
